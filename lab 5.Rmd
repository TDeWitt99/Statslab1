## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. Trust but verify. We trust that the `rnorm()` will generate random deviates in accordance with the definition of the normal distribution. For example, we learned in this lab, that a normal distribution with mean = 0, and sd = 1 , should only produce values larger than 2.5 with a specific small probability, that is P(x>2.5) = 0.006209665. Verify this is approximately the case by randomly sampling 1 million numbers from this distribution, and calculate what proportion of numbers are larger than 2.5.
```{r}
pnorm(2.5, mean = 0, sd =1, lower.tail=FALSE)
my_sample <- rnorm(1000000, mean =0, sd =1)
selection <- my_sample[my_sample > 2.5]
length(selection)/1000000
```
```If performance on a standardized test was known to follow a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 10, and 10,000 people took the test, how many people would be expected to achieve a score higher than 3 standard deviations from the mean?
```{r}
pnorm(q=130, mean =100, sd = 10, lower.tail = FALSE)
10000*pnorm(q=130, mean =100, sd = 10, lower.tail = FALSE)
# a simulation
some_observations <- rnorm(10000,mean=100, sd =10)
length(some_observations[some_observations > 130])/10000
```
```Create a sampling distribution of the mean for this scenario with at least 10,000 sample means (1 point).
```{r}
sampling_distribution <- replicate(10000, mean(rnorm(25, mean = 10,sd = 20)) )
hist(sampling_distribution)    
length(sampling_distribution[sampling_distribution >= 12])/10000
                                   
```
```You randomly sample **100** numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 10 and standard deviation = 20. You obtain a sample mean of 12. You want to know the probability that you could have received a sample mean of 12 or larger.
```{r}
sampling_distribution <- replicate(10000, mean(rnorm(100, mean = 10,sd = 20)) )
hist(sampling_distribution)    
length(sampling_distribution[sampling_distribution >= 12])/10000
```
```5. You randomly sample 25 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 10 and standard deviation = 20. You obtain a sample standard deviation of 15.
```{r}
sampling_distribution <- replicate(10000, sd(rnorm(25, mean = 10,sd = 20)) )
hist(sampling_distribution)    
length(sampling_distribution[sampling_distribution <= 15])/10000
```
