## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. Write a function that conducts a randomization test for the mean difference between two groups, and show that it works. Specifically, using your function, conduct a randomization test on the same data we used in the above example from lab. Report the results and briefly discuss what the results of the randomization tell you. (6 points).

```{r}
group_one <- c(3,4,5,6,7)

  # calculate actual means
  group_A_mean <- mean(A)
  group_B_mean <- mean(B)
  mean_difference <- group_A_mean - group_B_mean
  
  #conduct randomization
  all_means <- c(A,B)
  
  possible_differences <- c()
  for(i in 1:resamples){
    resample <- sample(all_means)
    new_A_mean <- mean(resample[1:length(A)])
    new_B_mean <- mean(resample[(length(A)+1):length(all_means)])
    possible_differences[i] <- new_A_mean-new_B_mean
  }
